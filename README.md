# Application Store

I have a tendency to bound around on projects and can't remember where I used some technique or some library. This tool will hopefully allow for me to document which applications I'm working on and more importantly what tech I'm using in each application.

## Speaking of which

I just abandoned an attempt to jump straight into T3 without knowing much about Prisma, Trpc, and barely knowing Nextjs... See: [App Store T3 implementation](https://github.com/fillip1984/app-store-T3)

Taking baby steps for now
